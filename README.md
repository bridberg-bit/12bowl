netlify dev

# Access at http://localhost:8888
```

```
https://yoursite.netlify.app?debug=true
```

Debug mode provides:

- Network request monitoring

### Admin Console Commands

Open browser console and use these commands:

```javascript
// Week Management
adminControls.setWeek(5)                    // Set current week
adminControls.getStatus()                   // Show current status

// Connection Testing  
adminControls.toggleOnlineMode()            // Toggle online/offline
adminControls.testBackend()                 // Test backend connection

// Data Management
adminControls.exportData()                  // Download all data as JSON
importFromFile()                            // Import data from JSON file
adminControls.resetSeason()                 // Reset all data (with confirmation)

// Game Simulation (for testing)
adminControls.simulateGameResults(2)        // Simulate results for week 2
adminControls.calculateWeekScores(2)        // Calculate scores for week 2
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Offline Mode" / Connection Issues
**Symptoms:** Red "üî¥ Offline Mode" indicator
**Solutions:**
```javascript
// Test backend connection
adminControls.testBackend()

// Check environment variables are set correctly
// Verify Google Sheets permissions
// Check Netlify function logs
```

#### 2. Google Sheets Permission Errors
**Symptoms:** 403 errors in network tab
**Solutions:**
- Ensure service account email has Editor access to the sheet

// Force save current picks
savePicks(true)

// Export data as backup
adminControls.exportData()
```

### Network Debugging

Check Netlify function logs:
```bash
netlify functions:logs
```

Monitor network requests in browser DevTools:
1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Filter by "Fetch/XHR"
